## Conversion Rate Expectations

Based on updated conversion rates in system:

### Traffic to Leads: 6%
- 1,000 visitors/month → 60 leads/month

### Leads to Customers: 35%
- 60 leads/month → 21 customers/month

### Combined Conversion: 2.1%
- 1,000 visitors/month → 21 customers/month

### Example ROI Calculation (Local Package)

**Baseline:** 500 visitors/month
**After SEO (6-12 months):** 1,000 visitors/month (2x growth)

- Leads: 1,000 × 6% = 60 leads/month
- Customers: 60 × 35% = 21 customers/month
- Revenue (£2,000 deal size): 21 × £2,000 = £42,000/month
- Annual Revenue Impact: £504,000/year

**SEO Investment:** £1,500/month × 12 = £18,000/year
**ROI:** £504,000 / £18,000 = **28x return**
