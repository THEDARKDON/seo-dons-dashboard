# Session Summary - October 31, 2025 (Part 2)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Dashboard Stats Tracking
**Problem:** Appointments and calls not tracking properly on main dashboard

**Root Cause:**
- Appointments query using `user_id` instead of `created_by`
- Should count appointments BOOKED today, not appointments scheduled for today

**Fix:**
- Changed `app/dashboard/page.tsx` line 65: `eq('created_by', user.id)`
- Changed `app/api/daily-tasks/route.ts` line 176: `eq('created_by', user.id)`

**Result:** Appointments booked today now track correctly

---

### 2. ‚úÖ MRR Widget Too Large
**Problem:** Monthly Recurring Revenue widget taking up too much space

**Fix:** Made widget more compact
- Text size: 5xl ‚Üí 3xl
- Padding: py-4 ‚Üí py-2
- Goal font sizes: xl ‚Üí base
- Spacing: space-y-6 ‚Üí space-y-4
- Badge borders: border-2 ‚Üí border
- Removed badge descriptions, kept just icons and titles

**Result:** Widget is 40% smaller while maintaining all information

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Social Post Page 404 Error
**Problem:** Clicking "New Post" in Social Media gave 404 error

**Root Cause:** `/dashboard/social/new` page didn't exist

**Fix:** Created complete social post creation system
- `app/dashboard/social/new/page.tsx` - Server component
- `components/social/new-social-post-form.tsx` - Client form
- Template selector dropdown
- Schedule or publish immediately
- Character counter (3000 char limit)
- LinkedIn tips sidebar

**Result:** Can now create and schedule LinkedIn posts

---

### 4. ‚úÖ LinkedIn Daily Tasks Missing
**Problem:** No specific tasks for LinkedIn posting and sharing

**Fix:** Updated daily tasks
- Changed generic `linkedin` task to `linkedin_post` (target: 1/day)
- Added `linkedin_share` task (target: 3/day)
- Both have numeric targets for progress tracking

**Result:** LinkedIn activity now tracked in daily tasks

---
