# CRM System Fixes Summary

## 1. Google Calendar Integration - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Manual appointment creation shows "calendar not connected" even when it is connected.

**Root Cause**: Mismatch in API response field name
- Frontend checking: `data.isConnected`  
- Backend returning: `data.connected`

**Fix Applied**: Updated `/app/dashboard/appointments/new/page.tsx` line 41:
```typescript
// Changed from:
setCalendarConnected(data.isConnected);
// To:
setCalendarConnected(data.connected);
```

## 2. Lead Import "source" Field Error - Investigation Needed ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: Error message "Lead import record 'new' has no field 'source'"

**Investigation Results**:
- Both lead import endpoints correctly use `lead_source` field (not `source`)
- The error might be coming from:
  1. A database trigger or function
  2. A different part of the application
  3. A frontend component trying to access a non-existent field

**Recommendation**: 
- Check browser console for the exact error location
- Check Supabase logs for database-level errors
- The error might be a misinterpretation of a different error

## 3. Phone Number Configuration - SQL Script Created üìû

**Issue**: Phone number +447700158258 shows "No user found for number" for inbound calls

**Root Cause**: The phone number might not be properly assigned in the `user_voip_settings` table

**Solution**: Created `fix_phone_number.sql` script:

1. Run the first query to check current assignments
2. If no assignment exists, uncomment and run the INSERT query
3. Verify with the final SELECT query

**Important**: Make sure to run this in your Supabase SQL editor.

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the calendar fix** - Try creating a manual appointment now
2. **For the lead import error**:
   - Check if the error still occurs
   - Look at browser developer console for exact error location
   - Check Supabase logs for any database errors
3. **For phone number issue**:
   - Run the SQL script in Supabase
   - Ensure the phone number is assigned to the correct user
   - Test inbound calls again

## Additional Notes:

- The calendar fix should resolve the immediate issue
- The lead import error needs more context - it might be a frontend display issue
- The phone number issue requires database access to fix properly
