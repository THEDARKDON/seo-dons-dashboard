## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

### Option A: Continue Building Features (Recommended)
Start with Phase 1 - Core CRUD Operations:
1. Deal Detail/Edit page (most impactful)
2. Customer Management (needed for deal associations)
3. Fix Appointments table query

### Option B: Polish Existing Features
Focus on Phase 5 - UX improvements:
1. Add search and filtering
2. Improve mobile responsiveness
3. Add loading states

### Option C: Production Deployment
Focus on Phase 7 - Security and deployment:
1. Set up proper RLS with Clerk JWT
2. Configure production environment
3. Set up Clerk webhook for user sync

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### No Blockers
All core infrastructure is in place:
- ✅ Database schema deployed
- ✅ Authentication working
- ✅ API routes functional
- ✅ UI components library ready

### Optional Dependencies
- **HubSpot:** Requires HubSpot account and API credentials
- **Slack:** Requires Slack workspace and webhook URL
- **Apollo.io:** Requires API key for customer enrichment

---

## Technical Debt

1. **Headers API Warnings**
   - Clerk middleware uses headers() synchronously
   - Next.js 15 requires async headers()
   - Non-breaking but spams console
   - Fix: Update to Clerk v6+ or use alternative auth pattern

2. **RLS Disabled**
   - Currently all tables have RLS disabled
   - Security risk for production
   - Fix: Implement Clerk JWT + RLS policies

3. **Manual User Sync**
   - New users must be manually added to database
   - Fix: Deploy Clerk webhook (code ready)

4. **No Error Boundaries**
   - Errors crash entire page
   - Fix: Add React error boundaries

5. **No Automated Testing**
   - No unit or integration tests
   - Risk of regressions
   - Fix: Add Jest + React Testing Library tests

---

## Success Metrics
