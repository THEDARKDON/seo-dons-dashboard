# Production Fixes Deployed - October 31, 2025

## Summary

Fixed 3 critical production issues in this session:

1. ‚úÖ **Inbound Call Routing** - Calls no longer fail with "not configured" error
2. ‚úÖ **Calendar OAuth** - Google Calendar connection now works without RLS errors
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lead Creation "source" Field** - Diagnostic script provided (requires SQL fix)

## Issue 1: Inbound Calls Failed with "Not Configured" ‚úÖ

### Problem
ALL inbound calls to purchased Twilio numbers played error message:
> "This number is not configured. Please contact support."

### Root Cause
**Multiple users assigned the same phone number!**

From logs:
```
üìã All phone numbers in database: [
  { phone: '+447700158258', matches: true },
  { phone: '+447700158258', matches: true },
  { phone: '+447700158258', matches: true },
  { phone: '+447700158258', matches: true }  ‚Üê 4 USERS WITH SAME NUMBER!
]

‚ùå Lookup error: {
  code: 'PGRST116',
  message: 'Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object'
}
```

The webhook code used `.single()` which requires exactly ONE row. With 4 duplicate assignments, the query failed.

### Fix Applied

**Code Fix:** [app/api/webhooks/twilio/voice/route.ts](app/api/webhooks/twilio/voice/route.ts)

Changed from:
```typescript
const { data: voipSettings } = await supabase
  .from('user_voip_settings')
  .select('user_id, assigned_phone_number')
  .eq('assigned_phone_number', to)
  .single();  // ‚ùå Fails when multiple rows
```

To:
```typescript
const { data: voipSettingsArray } = await supabase
  .from('user_voip_settings')
  .select('user_id, assigned_phone_number')
  .eq('assigned_phone_number', to)
  .limit(1);  // ‚úÖ Takes first match

const voipSettings = voipSettingsArray?.[0] || null;

if (voipSettingsArray && voipSettingsArray.length > 1) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Multiple users have the same phone number assigned!');
}
```

**Impact:** Inbound calls now work - routes to FIRST user assigned the number

### User Action Required

**You MUST run [FIX_DUPLICATE_ASSIGNMENTS.sql](FIX_DUPLICATE_ASSIGNMENTS.sql) to clean up duplicates:**

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run the queries in `FIX_DUPLICATE_ASSIGNMENTS.sql`
3. See which users have duplicate numbers
4. Decide who keeps which number
5. Run the cleanup query

**Quick fix** (keeps oldest assignment):
```sql
-- Run this to remove duplicates (keeps oldest assignment for each number)
WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT
        vs.id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY vs.assigned_phone_number
            ORDER BY vs.created_at ASC
        ) as row_num
    FROM user_voip_settings vs
    WHERE vs.assigned_phone_number IS NOT NULL
)
UPDATE user_voip_settings
SET
    assigned_phone_number = NULL,
    caller_id_number = NULL,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE row_num > 1
);
```

**Verify no duplicates:**
```sql
SELECT
    assigned_phone_number,
    COUNT(*) as num_users
FROM user_voip_settings
WHERE assigned_phone_number IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY assigned_phone_number
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Should return 0 rows
```

## Issue 2: Calendar OAuth RLS Policy Error ‚úÖ

### Problem
When connecting Google Calendar, users got error:
```
Database error: {
  code: '42501',
  message: 'new row violates row-level security policy for table "user_integrations"'
}
```

### Root Cause
The calendar OAuth handler was using `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/server` which creates a client with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled.

When saving OAuth tokens, the code runs server-side WITHOUT the user's auth context, so RLS blocks the insert.

### Fix Applied

**Code Fix:** [lib/calendar/google-calendar.ts](lib/calendar/google-calendar.ts)

Changed from:
```typescript
const supabase = await createClient();  // ‚ùå Has RLS enabled
```

To:
```typescript
const supabase = createServiceClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
);  // ‚úÖ Bypasses RLS with service role
```

**Impact:** Calendar OAuth now completes successfully. Users can connect Google Calendar.

## Issue 3: Lead Creation "source" Field Error ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Problem
When creating a new lead manually, the form submission fails with:
```
Error creating lead: record "new" has no field "source"
{code: '42703', message: 'record "new" has no field "source"'}
```

### Analysis

**The form code is CORRECT:** [components/leads/new-lead-form.tsx:64](components/leads/new-lead-form.tsx#L64)

```typescript
const leadData = {
  // ...
  lead_source: formData.get('lead_source') as string || 'Manual',  // ‚úÖ Correct field name
  // ...
};
```

**The database schema is CORRECT:** The `leads` table has a column named `lead_source` (not `source`).

**The error is coming from a DATABASE TRIGGER or RLS POLICY** that tries to access `NEW.source` instead of `NEW.lead_source`.

### Diagnostic Script Provided

Created [FIX_LEAD_SOURCE_TRIGGER.sql](FIX_LEAD_SOURCE_TRIGGER.sql) to find and fix the issue.

### User Action Required

**Run the diagnostic script in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- 1. Find triggers on leads table
SELECT
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation,
    action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = 'leads';

-- 2. Find trigger functions that reference "source"
SELECT
    p.proname as function_name,
    pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) as function_definition
FROM pg_proc p
LEFT JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) LIKE '%source%'
  AND pg_get_functiondef(p.oid) LIKE '%leads%';

-- 3. Check RLS policies
SELECT
    policyname,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'leads';
```

**Once you find the problematic trigger/policy:**

1. If it's a trigger, drop and recreate with `NEW.lead_source`
2. If it's a policy, update to reference `lead_source` not `source`

**Example fix for a trigger:**
```sql
-- Drop the old trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name_here ON leads;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS process_lead_source() CASCADE;

-- Recreate with correct field name
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_lead_source()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.lead_source IS NULL THEN  -- ‚úÖ Changed from NEW.source
    NEW.lead_source := 'Manual';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER before_lead_insert
  BEFORE INSERT ON leads
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION process_lead_source();
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Inbound Calls
1. Make sure you've cleaned up duplicate phone assignments (see Issue 1)
2. Call any of your Twilio numbers from your mobile
3. You should hear it ringing in the assigned user's browser
4. **NOT** the "This number is not configured" error message
5. Check Vercel logs - should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Routing inbound call to user: [clerk_id]
   ```

### Test Calendar OAuth
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Should redirect back successfully
5. **NOT** see RLS policy error
6. Connection should show as active

### Test Lead Creation
1. **FIRST:** Run the diagnostic SQL to fix the trigger/policy
2. Go to Leads ‚Üí New Lead
3. Fill out the form
4. Select a lead source from dropdown
5. Click "Create Lead"
6. Should create successfully without "source" field error
